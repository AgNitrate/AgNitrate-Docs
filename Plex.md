## Plex Guidelines  

#### Client Settings  
- In the Plex settings of every device that you install Plex Client (the player), make sure to set quality to maximum. Otherwise, my server will have to convert your video on the fly, which strains its CPU and quickly heats up my room. If your internet speed is slower than 24 Mbps (3 MBps), then you may have a problem with streaming the majority of movies. In that case, tell me and we can work out an alternative default setting. Otherwise, you are allowed to downgrade the quality to HD or SD when watching a 4k movie, but only if your internet bandwidth cannot handle it. 
TL;DR Always try to play media at its original quality.

- Additionally, it is recommended that you pin the libraries you want from my share to your home screen, for easy access. You can also unpin the default libraries provided by Plex if you find them annoying.  

#### Sharing  
- I'm sharing this with multiple people and use it myself. I also often do rendering and conversion jobs on the server that Plex is hosted on. Because of this, Plex may get unstable or laggy during heavy usage. If you're fine with that, then you can keep watching. Otherwise, stop and continue at another time. When I need the full resources of my server, I'll give a 30 minute warning to actively-watching users before shutting down Plex.  

#### Requesting  
- I don't mind movie and TV show requests, but you shouldn't expect them to be filled, especially for huge TV shows that easily take up half a terabyte of storage. I also take requests for media at a better quality than what I currently have.
- I try to download movies with embedded subtitles, but I can try to find subs for movies which don't currently have them. No guarantees, though.
- I'll probably fill all music requests, but it might take a while due to the way I import music.
